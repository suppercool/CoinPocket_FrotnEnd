            <p>
              Like most websites, we and our service providers collect
              information from your visits to our Site, to help us gather
              statistics about use and effectiveness, to evaluate the
              effectiveness of our ads both on and off our Site, to customize
              your experience on the Site, and to improve the quality of our
              Services. We do so through the use of various technologies,
              including cookies and tracking pixels. A cookie is a tiny data
              file that resides on your computer and allows us to recognize you
              when you return to the Site using the same computer and web
              browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in
              your browser, but in some cases doing so may impact your ability
              to use the Site. In addition to cookies, we use tracking pixels or
              web beacons, which collect certain standard information that your
              browser sends to our website such as your browser type and the
              address of the website from which you arrived at our website.
              Tracking pixels do not identify individual users and the analysis
              of data obtained by tracking pixels is generally performed on an
              aggregate basis for site usage analytics, advertising auditing and
              reporting, and content and advertising personalization.
            </p>

              When you visit our Site or open one of our emails, we may allow
              authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie,
              pixel, and/or similar technologies on your browser in order to
              provide you relevant advertisements as you surf the Internet.
              These advertisements may be targeted to you based on information
              these authorized third parties know or infer about you and include
              in the cookies placed on your browser and/or information about
              your Internet browsing activities gathered through your browser.
              Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements
              generally, you may control the collection of data on our site used
              for targeted advertising during your visits to other websites by
              sending us an email at info@LocumAccess.com and requesting that we
              opt you out of such activities. Please note that this does not opt
              you out of being served non-targeted advertising. You will
              continue to receive generic, non-targeted ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not
              track” feature that sends signals to the websites you visit,
              indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked.
              This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers
              with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies.
              There is currently no industry standard for how companies should
              respond to “do not track” signals, although one may develop in the
              future. We do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time;
              if we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy
              Policy. Our Site includes social media features and widgets, such
              as the Facebook “Like” button and the Facebook “Share” button.
              These features may collect your IP address, the URL of the page
              you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the
              feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets
              are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
              Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
